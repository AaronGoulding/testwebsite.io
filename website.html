This project allows the students of the course to show off their technical skill with any programming language of their choice.</p>

<h2> My coursework </h2>
<p> I decided that for my coursework I would create a junction simulation, this would only be the initial stages of my coursework however. I will then expand my project to include a section that controls the traffic lights on the junction. As the cars build up in the simulation the computer will be able to manage the flow of traffic and keep congestion and accidents to a minimum. </p>

        	setInterval(displayNextImage, 3000);

        function displayNextImage(){
        	if(pic == "red.jpg"){
            		pic = "redYellow.jpg"
